# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Farrukh

I'm the kind of nerd who reads research papers for fun and loves building cool stuff.

💡 My experience spans:

- Machine Learning
- Software Development
- AR Development

These days, AI has my full attention.

*Tools are just that—tools. It’s the problem that matters. I’ll learn whatever it takes to solve it.*
